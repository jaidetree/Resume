Resume

A template for a github resume idea

Introduction
============
I'm a web designer & developer with over 12 years of experience, got hooked when I was 10 and never stopped :D Also, I tend to get wiggy if I can't make anything at least once a day. No lies!

Goals
-----
My goal is really just to keep making things. To make things people enjoy, make things that make people's jobs easier or more fun while improving my work in each and every way I can. I want to work with small teams that tackle giant projects, to put in late nights to come home exhausted feeling completely satisfied knowing I put everthing I had into my projects. For me it's all about the journey, sure we can hack away some code to solve a problem in 30 minutes or we can take the time to really understand it and arrive at a complete solution that is easily maintained, well made, and much more robust.
